This is James. He lives in New York. This is Juan he lives in Mexico City.

James can use his mobile phone to find a route to anywhere he wants  using public transport because there is  open data for the timetables and routes. Thats why James take his bus on time everyday.
But imagine what would happen if such data is not available.

This is what happens where Juan Lives, in Mexico City. Juan is on a hurry to get to his new job, but he has no idea which bus to take. Juan doesn’t know this place very well and has asked several people for directions without success.  He has a few navigation apps in his mobile phone, but none of them tell him which bus to take. Juan is probably going to be late to work today...

 What if there was an app that could tell Juan how to get anywhere using public transit?
That’s the idea behind Omni, an app that helps you get anywhere in Mexico City using the public transport system. Omni helps you find routes that combine several public transit options, and even some alternative options

Using Omni, Juan can find his way to work without asking for directions on the street or getting lost.
Juan was able to get to work on time today and without hassles. Omni is simple to use: just tell it where you wanna go … and choose among the options it presents to you
You can select routes using multiple criteria: the fastest route, the cheapest, or even a combination of both. Omni will also remember your personal preferences, to provide you a better experiece.
